# MoCaml - A mocking framework for OCaml

The goal of this library is to provide a framework for automatically generating mock modules for OCaml. This library is inspired by the excellent JMock library for Java, and follows the patterns of the also excellent xUnit book.

This is currently a work in progress, and right now is little more than a scratch pad for working out implementation ideas. Hopefully there will be something more usable soon.
